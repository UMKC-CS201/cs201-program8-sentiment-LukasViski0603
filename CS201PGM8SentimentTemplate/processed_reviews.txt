FORMATTED REVIEW: 
An interesting local place with river views and good food in the moderate price
range. It leans heavily toward sea food but there are menu items for the foul
and bovine inclined. Reservations for diner are a must, particularly on Friday
and Saturday or any day a popular show is appearing at the Count Basie Theatre.
Two appetizers and two entrees with nonalcoholic drinks set us back $91 with
tip. Fairly reasonable. We sat at a lovely set, uncomplicated, table with a
beautiful view of the Navesink river and it's boat traffic. The service was
polite, amiable and generally proficient about seeing to our needs. On this day
I opened with the caprese salad which was very nicely done. The pesto was a
tasty accent, not over powering. The wet mozzarella perfect and heirloom
tomatoes glorious. They flavors coming together very nicely. My wife had an
oyster dish that I'm having a senior moment trying to pull the name from
memory, however it's sauce was delicious (I'm not a big oyster fan). I kept my
entree simple: fish and chips. The fish was a nice thick piece of cod, not some
cod replacement and fried to perfection. The fries were fries. :) My wife had
the lobster roll, which she gave high marks. Overall a good place to dine
before a show or after a late afternoon/ early evening walk about. It's not
child adverse and a few dotted the tables while we were there but, at dinner at
least, it runs toward an adult crowd. The parking can be difficult on popular
show nights or Friday evening but the municipal lot is just across the street
and you don't have to pay after 6pm. It's a thumbs up here.

Garon is undoubtedly the most welcoming and nice host ever. You feel at home
right away, he is exciting and passionate, discussions are super interesting
and he is extremely friendly. A stay at his place is a good mood cure. I highly
recommend! It was so nice staying at Garon's! For the first glance it didn't
look very fancy or something, but this place is gorgeous from inside out. It's
pretty easy to get to subway G train or if you walk a little more you can get
to A train which goes directly to JFK airport. Garon is a very kind person,
very open-minded and friendly! We also have a lot in common in area of culture!
I'll recommend this place to everyone who is open-minded and want to feel how
people live there in NYC. Neighborhood looked safe. Despite it was one of the
coldest weeks for last year in town, but heating worked well and the room was
warm! "I had the most beautiful stay, Garon is a very special person and an
absolute angel, made me feel totally at home in a highly peaceful and relaxed
environment, I throughly recommend Bliss Art Space!

"For $70/night a few blocks from Times Square....you can't beat it. Here is
what I found recently (mid October, 2017). Shunichi went out of his way (via
text) to accommodate my late morning arrival (before he had a chance to clean
from another guest who had not even left yet). I met him at his employment
where he gave me keys and directions for setting my bags down in his living
room. From Penn Station to his place, a taxi would normally cost about $10
(including tip). From Penn to his employment (opposite direction) and then to
his place was about $30 total. Easy to walk the distance(s) if you do not have
heavy bags to carry (I did). I would say his neighborhood is quite safe. Basic
needs are in the room. If you expect super basic you will not be disappointed,
if you expect “style,” then this is not a place for you. I would say that
is it clean “enough,” but I did not take a shower. Keys: the key to locks
of both building entrance doors (2) are not well aligned. I struggled for a
couple of minutes, almost called him (and I can’t really say what to do to
get it to work). Key to apt. itself is fine. Never having stayed in downtown
NYC, I was interested to learn about noise. Sunichi’s place is about 6 houses
in from a main drag (8th Street) and on the second floor. I was impressed with
how little I heard from the outside (with the window open a couple of inches),
only an occasional siren on 8th (main drag). I slept in until 8:30...sweet!
Would I stay there again? I would consider it, but I’d look around for
another possibility, too."

For my stay the apartment was also not ideal, there is no couch, only cushions
on the floor and there is no real table and chairs. I had to work from home
sometimes and could not really do it anywhere. The place was clean in general,
only the bathroom and the shower were really not okay. Especially the shower
curtain was mildewed. The kitchen was clean and well equipped. Apartment has an
AC, which is definitely a pro.

The Midtown Castle is a beautiful place to stay in the center of the city.
Truly a sanctuary with everything you need. Little touches of nature and beauty
throughout. Waking up with the sun from the skylight was amazing. This
apartment is convenient and functional. The huge skylight makes it feel open
and airy. And it is located smack dab in the middle of Manhattan. Highly
recommended. Great place. Would definitely recommend! Jennifer is really sweet
and easy going. Beautiful and stylish spot in a very unique building! Jennifer
is a wonderful host and was kind enough to meet us for out late-night check-in.
We loved the apartment! Jennifer's space was such a lovely experience.
PreCheckin and checkin was detailed and seamless, she made it easier on us and
answered all questions so quickly. The space itself is such a unique, clear &
zen energy- we loved it. Not to mention it was very clean & close to
everything! Definitely be prepared for the 4flight workout (we appreciated
that)! We enjoyed the space and location & would recommend this to anyone
coming to explore the city!! "Jennifer was super friendly and helpful. Great
host with an amazing studio apartment right in the middle of NYC. Everything is
walking distance! The Empire State Building, Times Square, and New York library
were all around the corner or less than 15 minutes walk. Best location ever and
great relaxing place to stay.

Would say our greatest compliments to Jennifer, the host of Midtown Castle. We
spent in this lovely apartment in the heart of Manhattan one month (April,
2012) and will remember this time as ours best. The apartment is pretty
spacious and great located - the 5-th Ave right around the corner. There is
everything you can need during your short or long stay. Jennifer is very
friendly, vigorous and very responsible host. Thanks her and highly recomend
this apartment for everyone who are looking for a quiet place right in the
center of the boiling Midtown!" We had a wonderful stay at Jennifer's charming
apartment! They were very organized and helpful; I would definitely recommend
staying at the Midtown Castle!

with river views and good food in the moderate price range. It leans heavily
toward sea food but there are menu items for the foul and bovine inclined.
Reservations for diner are a must, particularly on Friday and Saturday or any
day a popular show is appearing at the Count Basie Theatre. Two appetizers and
two entrees with nonalcoholic drinks set us back $91 with tip. Fairly
reasonable. We sat at a lovely set, uncomplicated, table with a beautiful view
of the Navesink river and it's boat traffic. The service was polite, amiable
and generally proficient about seeing to our needs. On this day I opened with
the caprese salad which was very nicely done. The pesto was a tasty accent, not
over powering. The wet mozzarella perfect and heirloom tomatoes glorious. They
flavors coming together very nicely. My wife had an oyster dish that I'm having
a senior moment trying to pull the name from memory, however it's sauce was
delicious (I'm not a big oyster fan). I kept my entree simple: fish and chips.
The fish was a nice thick piece of cod, not some cod replacement and fried to
perfection. The fries were fries. :) My wife had the lobster roll, which she
gave high marks. Overall a good place to dine before a show or after a late
afternoon/ early evening walk about. It's not child adverse and a few dotted
the tables while we were there but, at dinner at least, it runs toward an adult
crowd. The parking can be difficult on popular show nights or Friday evening
